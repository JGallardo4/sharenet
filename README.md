Sharenet is a website that facilitates the
giving and receiving of useful items and
materials. The goal is to put into practice
the idea of a Gift Economy.

Sharenet is part of Project U, an initiative
to create small societies that achieve a high level
of independence from the economic system in which they
exist. 

The goal is that the members of these societies
will be able to do more with less money. Needing
less money they will be able to work less. And working
less they will achieve a greater level of lifestyle
satisfaction by focusing their time and energy into
the things they care about such as their hobbies and
spending time with their loved ones.
