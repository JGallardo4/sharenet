 Proposed System:
 - Item owners submit an entry into the site representing each item
 or service they wish to share with the community. Posts are well 
 categorized, include a picture, title, and description.

 - Other users search for items or services that they need.

 - Search results can be sorted by proximity.

 - Goods can be shared in two ways: "Share by Turns" and "Give Away."

"Share by Turns"
- Items can be held on to for up to a month.
During this time the item is marked as "In Use," and
users can apply to take custodianship of it next.

- After applying for an item, users are put into a queue on a
first-come-first-served basis.

- When a user becomes the temporary custodian of an item (for up
to a month) they are encouraged to perform any maintenance on
it that is deemed necessary.

- When a user is done with an item before the month is done
they can mark it as "Available" in the system.

- The transfer from the current custodian to the next user in
the queue is arranged between the two.

- The original owner is able to reclaim their property. They are
put in the queue. Afterwards the queue is closed. When the item
reaches the original owner it is removed from the system,
with the option to be put back into circulation at a later
date should the owner choose to do so.
  
"Give Away"
- The person who first claims the item gets to keep it. They can
decide whether or not to give it away or share it by turns later on.

- The original owner does not have a right to claim the item back.

For services:
- Services can be marked as "Available" or "Not Available"
- Users can apply for a service
- Service providers can accept an application and arrange 
details with the user applying for a service
- Service providers can cancel a service at any time.

Discouraging Abuse:
- There will be a reputation sytem in place.
- Users will incur a loss of reputation for the
following actions:
- Passing down an item in an unusable state
- Being late to part with an item
- Refusing to part with an item

Encouraging Participation:
- Reputation can be gained by:
- Giving items and services
